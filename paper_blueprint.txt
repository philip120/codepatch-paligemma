2. Abstract
(A 4-5 sentence summary of the entire paper)
Sentence 1 (The Problem): The task of understanding and summarizing scientific code, such as MATLAB scripts that generate plots, is a significant challenge for automated systems.
Sentence 2 (The Solution): We introduce CodePatch, a novel multimodal architecture that adapts a vision-language model to this task by replacing the vision encoder with a specialized code encoder (CodeBERT) and representing code as a sequence of semantic "patches" derived from its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Sentence 3 (The Method): We demonstrate a robust training methodology using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to stably and efficiently adapt the model to this new domain.
Sentence 4 (The Results): Our experiments show that CodePatch is significantly more memory-efficient, reducing the initial KV cache size by up to 50%, while achieving comparable or superior performance on text generation quality (ROUGE scores) compared to a standard baseline language model.
Sentence 5 (The Impact): This work presents a successful and efficient method for deep code comprehension with applications in automated documentation, code review, and accessibility.
3. Introduction
The Big Picture: Start with the importance of code comprehension and the difficulty of understanding scientific code.
The Specific Problem: Narrow down to the challenge of describing a plot from its source code without visual execution. Why is this useful? (e.g., for blind programmers, for automated documentation).
Your Solution (in a nutshell): Introduce the core idea of CodePatch: treating code like an image. Mention the key innovations: replacing the vision encoder and using the AST for semantic patching.
List of Contributions: State your contributions clearly.
The novel CodePatch architecture.
The AST-based semantic patching technique.
A detailed methodology for stably fine-tuning this architecture using PEFT/LoRA.
